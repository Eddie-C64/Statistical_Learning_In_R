## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
set.seed(2)
n = 500
x = matrix(rnorm(n*2),ncol = 2)
x[1:25, 1] = x[1:25,1]+3
x[1:25, 2] = x[1:25,2]-4
km.out = kmeans(x, 2, nstart=20)
km.out$cluster
plot(x, col=(km.out$cluster+1), main="K-Mean Clustering Results with K=2", xlab = "",ylab = "", pch=20, cex=2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Take 2!}
set.seed(4)
km.out=kmeans(x,5,nstart = 50)
km.out
plot(x, col=(km.out$cluster+1), main="K-Means Clustering Results with K=5", xlab="", pch=20, cex=2)
```

```{r Numbero Tres}
set.seed(3)
km.out=kmeans(x,3,nstart = 1)
km.out$tot.withinss
km.out = kmeans(x, 3, nstart = 20)
km.out$tot.withinss
```
